# kickstarter-status

The goal of this project is to identify trends in successful, failed, and canceled Kickstarter campaigns that may help future campaigns find success. This included the organization and analysis of 4,000 campaigns, running the data through pivot tables. The project concluded with a review of conclusions I was able to draw as well as identifying limitations in the data.
